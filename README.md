# Why using DevDash?

* Unlimited amount of different dashboards with different configurations.
* Widgets' data refreshed automatically.
* A huge amount of flexibility compared to other terminal dashboards:
  * Choose the widgets you want.
  * Place your widgets where you want.
  * Choose the data you want to display, the colors you want to use, and a lot of other things for each widget.

# Acknowledgement

Thanks to [MariaLetta](https://github.com/MariaLetta/free-gophers-pack) for the awesome and beautiful Gopher pack she made! I used it for my logo on top.

DevDash was inspired from other open source projects:

* [wtf](https://github.com/wtfutil/wtf)
* [tdash](https://github.com/jessfraz/tdash)

# Contribute

First of all, thanks a lot if you want to contribute to DevDash!

I think the ["talk, then code"](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/contributing) practice is pretty good to avoid misunderstandings and hours of work for nothing.

Therefore:

"Every new feature or bug fix should be discussed with the maintainer(s) of the project before work commences. Itâ€™s fine to experiment privately, but do not send a change without discussing it first."

# Making Of

For anybody interested how I managed to develop DevDash on side of a full time job, and how I organized my time and kept my motivation, [I wrote an article about that on my blog](https://thevaluable.dev/programming-side-project-example-devdash/).
